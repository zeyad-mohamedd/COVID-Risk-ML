# COVID-Risk-ML 🦠

## 📜 Project Description
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the risk levels of countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing critical data such as deaths, confirmed cases, and recoveries, the model classifies countries into risk categories to support informed decision-making.

## 🛠️ Installation 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-Risk-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd COVID-Risk-ML
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📊 Usage 
Run the main script to train the models and make predictions:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🎯 Objective 
The model evaluates the risk level of each country based on its mean death rate and other COVID-19 statistics. The final output provides a classification of high-risk and low-risk countries.
